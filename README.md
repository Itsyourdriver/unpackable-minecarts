# Contributing
You can contribute by creating pull requests for updates/compat, and reporting issues.


# Future Plans
Finish compat for more mods.

# Branches
`main` - 1.20.1 Primary Branch, most compatibility will be pushed here as most mods aren't updated.
`1.21` - 1.21, I plan on renaming it to latest as this branch will just be where I push updates for the latest version of minecraft.
